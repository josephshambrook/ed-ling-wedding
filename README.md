# Edward and Ling - Wedding Website

This is a static, multilingual website I'm writing for my younger brother's wedding. Built with GatsbyJS, and deployed to Netlify.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing**

    Once cloned, navigate into the siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
